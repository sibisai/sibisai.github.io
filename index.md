### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Part 2 of lab 4 was one of my favorite projects because it was my first time creating a game. It was enjoyable because it gave me a chance to create a simple guessing game and practice my problem-solving skills. I learned about the importance of planning, organizing code, and testing and debugging. This experience taught me the importance of being patient and persistent when finding and fixing code errors.

* Lab 5

    In Lab 5 Part 2, we developed a program to calculate the score of a two-card blackjack hand. The input consists of two card names provided as command line arguments. The program validates the arguments and calculates the score based on blackjack rules. If the input is invalid, it displays an error message and returns a non-zero exit code. The program features several functions, such as IsAce, IsFaceCard, IsNumberCard, IsCardName, CardPoints, IsBust, and HandScore. We also completed the main function, which handles argument validation, score calculation, and output display. This lab allowed us to understand blackjack rules, command line argument handling, input validation, and decomposing complex problems into smaller functions.

* Lab 7

    In Lab 7 Part 1, my partner and I developed a Multi-Turn Hi-Lo Game in C++ using a provided Makefile. The game allowed players five attempts to guess a secret number given as a command-line argument, with specific output strings for different scenarios. We first analyzed the game requirements and necessary output strings, then collaboratively implemented the code using the starter code as guidance. We tested our program using provided test cases and the make test command, ensuring correct output in all situations. To debug, we employed various techniques to address compile, runtime, and logic errors. We also used make lint and make format commands to identify and fix formatting or linting issues. Overall, the lab improved our programming and problem-solving skills, as well as our ability to work in a team.
